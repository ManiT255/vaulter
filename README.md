# vaulter
The timing attack is a variation from mCoding with a provided file named vault.o.  This will only work if the application can be brute forced and doesn't lock down.  Change your filename to what it is being tested and may need to be updated to provide a password guess.  The timing attack looks to see how the file responds to a password and specific password lengths.  The longer it takes at a certain length the better and gives you and idea on the length of the password.  Depending on the length you may want to add a password list with the known length or just let the crack_password attempt at random.  This code accepts the best timing and then brute forces the attack.
